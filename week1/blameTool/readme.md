# Blametool

**For blaming the tools that messed with your repo.**

Starting from the pun "openBlameworks" and watching a bunch of Law & Order while working on Git-tracked projects put the notion of blame and fault deep in my brain. And also there were jokes.

Using OpenCV & Haar detection this app finds a face-like set of pixels and places blame next to it. The location of the blame tries to stay in the empty part of the screen.

As demoed, the app is launched from the command line marketed as a tool for troubleshooting errors in a git repository. Instead of anything helpful the user sees that it was his or her fault.

This past week I started using openFrameworks and Xcode for the first time. The process of getting started was very frustrating and I found myself complaining and saying it was either openFrameworks's or Xcode's fault. Then after a half hour to an hour I'd discover that there was some part of the process that I was doing wrong.
